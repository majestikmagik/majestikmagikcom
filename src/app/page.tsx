If using <a> tags for button-like behavior, add onclick=\"event.preventDefault();\"\nUse modern, clean design principles.\nDo not use navigation links going back to the Majestik Magik website. Keep the buttons anchor links blank.\nUse placeholder text and images (e.g., using https://placehold.co/ for images, like https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Concept+Placeholder).\nFocus on delivering a clear, simple, and functional concept that the user can quickly understand or adapt.\nSince this is a free concept generator, the output should be less comprehensive than a full website preview. It's more like a \"starter idea\" or a \"block template\".\nFor example, if the user asks for \"a hero section for a startup\", generate only that hero section. If they ask for \"a product card layout\", generate a few example cards in a responsive grid. If \"a simple contact form structure\", generate the HTML form elements with basic styling.\nMake it clean and functional. Use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate.\nTailor the actual output to the user's specific prompt.\nYour entire response must be ONLY the code block. Do not include any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown fences like \\\`\\\`\\\`language ... \\\`\\\`\\\`. Just the raw code.`

Any mobile view/media queries should be within the embedded <style> tag.\nThe output must be ONLY the HTML code, starting with <!DOCTYPE html> and ending with </html>.\nThe body tag should include oncontextmenu=\"event.preventDefault(); return false;\" to prevent inspect element on right click in the iframe.`

It should not be wrapped in markdown fences.\nExample structure (do not include the 'import React from \"react\";' line):\n\\\`\\\`\\\`tsx\n// import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; <--- DO NOT INCLUDE THIS LINE\n\n// Define any interfaces or types needed by the component here, if any.\n// interface GeneratedConceptProps { /* ... */ }\n\nconst GeneratedConcept: React.FC<any> = (props) => { // Use 'any' for props if not specified\n  // Component logic and JSX.
